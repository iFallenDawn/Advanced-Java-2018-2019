# Advanced Java 2018-2019
A portfolio of files from my senior year Advanced Java class. This consists of various projects ranging from data structures and competitive programming from ACSL (American Computer Science League). 

There is also an entire introductory Python curriculum designed by the students across our two Advanced Java classes, complete with PowerPoints, program specifications, and program skeletons.
